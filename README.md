7. Dont forget to execute 'source ~/.bashrc' at the end.

### Why do I have to manualy execute 'source ~/.bashrc'?
The reason that this can't be done by the program itself is that it wouldn't be applied to the main shell but only for the runtime of the program itself. After the program exits, all changes will be reverted.
